Implementation of maze navigation, search algorithms, and control systems for the e-puck robot in Webots 2023b.

This repository contains my solutions to the Digital / Computer Controlled Systems laboratory mini-projects at Amirkabir University of Technology.

The project focuses on:

Autonomous maze exploration

BFS / DFS traversal

Line following

Closed-loop motion control using a PID controller

Returning to the start position after mission completion
